# car_project
Car sales project 

This is the app about exploring the data about used cars. In this app you can:
* Find whole used cars dataset
* Visualize how the year of manufacture affects car condition with interactive histograms
* Explore price distribution by manufacturer.
* Use select boxes to filter by fuel type, transmission type, and car type for tailored insights. 

To implement this project have been used libraries such as pandas, streamlit, plotly and pyplot and streamlit methods such as st.write, st.title, st.checkbox, st.plotly chart and so on.

To launch this project on your local machine you should open the car_app.py file and write in the terminal  python3 -m streamlit run .\car_app.py
